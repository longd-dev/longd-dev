# 👋 Hi, I'm Long Duong  

I'm a **Full-Stack Developer** passionate about building modern, scalable, and user-friendly web applications.  
With hands-on experience in **MERN stack development**, real-time applications, and cloud deployment, I enjoy turning ideas into fully functional products.  

💡 My focus areas:  
- 🛠️ Full-Stack Development (React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB)  
- 🎨 Responsive & Scalable UI Design (Tailwind CSS, modern component libraries)  
- ⚡ Real-Time Applications (Socket.IO, WebSockets)  
- 💳 Payment Integration (Stripe, Razorpay)
